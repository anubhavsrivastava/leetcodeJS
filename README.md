# leetcodeJS

Personal solution for leetcode problem using Javascript.

## Why?

This is personal attempt for leetcode problems. Over period of time with web development, I felt I was more into that part of CS that involves understanding contracts(RFCs, HTML5, ES, etc) and specifications(WCAG, REST, etc) that revolves around Browser and Web.
The motivation behind this is to get back to some problem solving aspect of CS and also get better command over JS language.

## Environment

Chrome/Nodejs (depending on time taken, easy-small problems on browser)

## Problem Organisation

Starting with two params - difficulty and most attempted problems. And subsequently increasing difficulty.
Problems are organised in respective difficulty Folder -easy, medium, hard (As tagged on leetcode.com).
There is also a seperate section as another solution for individual problems for solutions that are different/better/optimised/ideal.

Complete list of solved problems in order of Problem number can be seen [here](Problems.md)
