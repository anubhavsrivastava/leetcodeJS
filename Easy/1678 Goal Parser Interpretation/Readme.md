## Problem

You own a Goal Parser that can interpret a string command. The command consists of an alphabet of "G", "()" and/or "(al)" in some order. The Goal Parser will interpret "G" as the string "G", "()" as the string "o", and "(al)" as the string "al". The interpreted strings are then concatenated in the original order.

Given the string command, return the Goal Parser's interpretation of command.



Example 1:

Input: command = "G()(al)"
Output: "Goal"
Explanation:Â The Goal Parser interprets the command as follows:
G -> G
() -> o
(al) -> al
The final concatenated result is "Goal".

Example 2:

Input: command = "G()()()()(al)"
Output: "Gooooal"

Example 3:

Input: command = "(al)G(al)()()G"
Output: "alGalooG"



Constraints:

1 <= command.length <= 100
command consists of "G", "()", and/or "(al)" in some order.

## Pre analysis

Simple loop through the string and replace the string with the given condition.

## Post analysis

Using replaceAll function, it can be done in one line.

## Complexity Analysis

Time complexity: O(N)
Space complexity: O(N)

## Another solution

```javascript
var interpret = function (command) {
  return command.split("()").join("o").split("(al)").join("al");
};
```

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} command
 * @return {string}
 */
var interpret = function (command) {
  return command.replaceAll("()", "o").replaceAll("(al)", "al");
};
```
