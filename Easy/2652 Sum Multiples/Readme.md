## Problem

Given a positive integer n, find the sum of all integers in the range [1, n] inclusive that are divisible by 3, 5, or 7.

Return an integer denoting the sum of all numbers in the given range satisfyingÂ the constraint.



Example 1:

Input: n = 7
Output: 21
Explanation: Numbers in the range [1, 7] that are divisible by 3, 5, or 7 are 3, 5, 6, 7. The sum of these numbers is 21.

Example 2:

Input: n = 10
Output: 40
Explanation: Numbers in the range [1, 10] that are divisible by 3, 5, or 7 are 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10. The sum of these numbers is 40.

Example 3:

Input: n = 9
Output: 30
Explanation: Numbers in the range [1, 9] that are divisible by 3, 5, or 7 are 3, 5, 6, 7, 9. The sum of these numbers is 30.



Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10^3

## Pre analysis

Will loop over numbers and check if divisible by 3, 5 or 7. If yes, add to sum.
Just wondering if there is a mathematical formula to calculate this.
