## Problem

You are given two arrays of equal length, nums1 and nums2.

Each element in nums1 has been increased (or decreased in the case of negative) by an integer, represented by the variable x.

As a result, nums1 becomes equal to nums2. Two arrays are considered equal when they contain the same integers with the same frequencies.

Return the integer x.

Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [2,6,4], nums2 = [9,7,5]

Output: 3

Explanation:

The integer added to each element of nums1 is 3.

Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [10], nums2 = [5]

Output: -5

Explanation:

The integer added to each element of nums1 is -5.

Example 3:

Input: nums1 = [1,1,1,1], nums2 = [1,1,1,1]

Output: 0

Explanation:

The integer added to each element of nums1 is 0.

Constraints:

1 <= nums1.length == nums2.length <= 100
0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000
The test cases are generated in a way that there is an integer x such that nums1 can become equal to nums2 by adding x to each element of nums1.

## Pre analysis

Will find the difference of sum of both arrays and divide it by the length of the array.

## Another Solution

1. We can find the difference of minimum element of both arrays

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums1
 * @param {number[]} nums2
 * @return {number}
 */
var addedInteger = function (nums1, nums2) {
  return Math.min(...nums2) - Math.min(...nums1);
};
```

2. We can sort both arrays and find the difference of first element of both arrays

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums1
 * @param {number[]} nums2
 * @return {number}
 */
var addedInteger = function (nums1, nums2) {
  nums1.sort((a, b) => a - b);
  nums2.sort((a, b) => a - b);
  return nums2[0] - nums1[0];
};
```
